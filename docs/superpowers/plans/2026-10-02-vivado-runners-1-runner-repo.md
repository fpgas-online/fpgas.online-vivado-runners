# Vivado Runners 1: Runner Repository Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Create `fpgas-online/fpgas.online-vivado-runners`: the controller that runs one throwaway KVM VM per GitHub Actions job, the scripts that build the VM image and the Vivado disk, the host proxy and firewall configuration, and a Debian package of all of it.

**Architecture:** A Python service keeps a fixed number of slots. Each slot asks GitHub for a single-job (JIT) runner config, boots a transient libvirt VM from a copy-on-write overlay, waits for it to power off, and deletes everything. GitHub and libvirt sit behind small interfaces so the slot logic is tested with fakes. Host-side network policy (libvirt network, nftables table, squid allowlist) ships as static files in the package.

**Tech Stack:** Python 3.13 (Debian 13), stdlib + PyJWT/cryptography, `virsh`, `qemu-img`, `xorriso`, `virt-install`, squid, nftables, pytest, ruff, uv, debhelper/pybuild, `mithro/apt-repo-action`.

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-vivado-runners-design.md` (moves into the new repo in Task 1).

**This is plan 1 of 3.** Plan 2 deploys this to a runner host and proves the sandbox. Plan 3 adds the Vivado jobs to test-designs.

## Global Constraints

- Repository: `fpgas-online/fpgas.online-vivado-runners`, Apache-2.0, default branch `main`.
- Python package `vivado_runners`, console script `vivado-runners`, Debian package `vivado-runners`, system user `vivado-runners`.
- Target OS: Debian 13 (trixie) on x86-64 with KVM. That is all the system assumes about a runner host. Python floor 3.11 (`tomllib`).
- **Host independence.** No code, package file, unit, image script or test may contain a host's name, address, CPU list or memory size. A host's short name is read from the hostname (overridable in the config); its NUMA layout, CPU count, memory and addresses are read from the host at run time. Tests use the made-up hosts `alpha` and `beta`. The only per-host settings are how much of the host the runners may use (`slots.count`, `slots.vcpus`, `slots.memory_gib`, `slots.scratch_gib`).
- Runtime Python dependencies: stdlib, `PyJWT`, `cryptography`. Nothing else.
- All Python commands run through `uv` (`uv run pytest`, `uv run ruff`). Never plain `python` or `pip`.
- No shell with loops, conditionals or more than two commands: write Python.
- Dates are ISO 8601 (`2026-10-02`). Never month-first.
- Never write to `/tmp`; never redirect stderr to `/dev/null`; never `ssh-keyscan -H`.
- Runner subnet is `192.168.76.0/24`, bridge `vrbr0`, libvirt network `vivado-runners`, host/proxy address `192.168.76.1:3128`. Slot `i` (0-based, at most 8 slots) has MAC `52:54:00:76:00:<i as 2 hex digits>` and IP `192.168.76.<10+i>`.
- VM domain name `vr-<host>-<i>`. Runner name `<host>-slot<i>-<8 hex>`.
- Runner labels: `self-hosted`, `linux`, `x64`, `vivado-2025.2`. Runner group: `vivado`.
- State directory `/var/lib/vivado-runners`; images in `/var/lib/vivado-runners/images`; config in `/etc/vivado-runners/config.toml`; GitHub App key `/etc/vivado-runners/app.pem`.
- Image names: `runner-base-<YYYY-MM-DD>.<n>.qcow2`, `vivado-<version>-<YYYY-MM-DD>.squashfs`; symlinks `runner-base-current`, `vivado-current`. Nothing deletes an image automatically.
- No credential other than the JIT config ever enters a VM. The host never mounts or parses a disk a job VM has written to.
- Nothing containing Vivado is ever uploaded anywhere (AMD's EULA forbids redistribution).
- **Licences.** This plan supports only Vivado versions that need no licence file (the free Standard edition covers every current target). No licence file tied to a machine may ever be in the runner image, on the Vivado disk, in a seed, in this repository or in a log: a job can read everything in its VM. The Vivado disk build refuses a tree that holds one. The generic licences AMD ships inside the product (`HOSTID=ANY`) are fine. Licensed versions, which need a network device with a specific MAC address, are Phase 6, set out in the spec ("Vivado licences"); nothing here may make that harder, and each VM's network card keeps the fixed per-slot MAC from the line above.
- One PR per task group (listed under "Pull requests"); CI green before the next; merge with `gh pr merge --merge`, never squash.
- Every commit message ends with these two lines:
  ```

  Claude-Session: https://claude.ai/code/session_01LmomwnyBcsZWKXnx2Thc2Y
  ```

## Differences from the first draft of the spec (the spec was revised to match on 2026-10-03)

1. **No `_diag` copy.** The spec has the controller loop-mount the scratch disk to read the runner's diagnostic log. That makes the host parse a filesystem a hostile job controls. The controller logs the runner name instead; GitHub's jobs API reports the same name as `runner_name`, which ties a log line to a run.
2. **Threads, not asyncio.** Every hypervisor call is a blocking subprocess, so each slot is a thread.
3. **Seed is a read-only virtio disk holding an ISO 9660 image**, found in the guest by its serial (`vr-seed`).
4. **`--disableupdate` is a `config.sh` flag and JIT runners never run `config.sh`.** Whether a JIT runner self-updates is checked in Plan 2 by decoding a JIT config. Either way GitHub stops sending jobs to a runner more than 30 days behind the latest release, so the base image is rebuilt at least monthly (Plan 2 adds the reminder).
5. **Phase 1's exit check "image boots under the controller locally" moves to Plan 2.** The machine with the Vivado install has no libvirt; the first boot happens on the first runner host.
6. **Packages publish through `mithro/apt-repo-action`** (signed apt repo on GitHub Pages), as nfsroot-watchdog does, not through a `debs` release.

### Task 1: Repository, skeleton and CI

**Files:**
- Create: `pyproject.toml`, `src/vivado_runners/__init__.py`, `tests/test_smoke.py`, `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- Create: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-vivado-runners-design.md` and the three plans (copied from test-designs PR #93)

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: importable package `vivado_runners` with `__version__: str`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Ask Tim before creating the repository**

Creating a public repo is outward-facing. Ask: "Create `fpgas-online/fpgas.online-vivado-runners` (public, Apache-2.0) now?" Proceed only on yes.

- [ ] **Step 2: Create and configure the repository**

Invoke the `github-repo-setup:github-setup` skill and apply its checklist to:

```bash
gh repo create fpgas-online/fpgas.online-vivado-runners --public --license apache-2.0 \
  --description "Sandboxed per-job KVM GitHub Actions runners with Vivado, for fpgas.online"
gh repo clone fpgas-online/fpgas.online-vivado-runners ~/github/fpgas-online/fpgas.online-vivado-runners
```

Branch protection and LFS-in-archives need Tim (the skill cannot set them). Say so when reporting.

- [ ] **Step 3: Create a worktree for PR A**

Use the `superpowers:using-git-worktrees` skill; branch `skeleton`, path `.worktrees/skeleton`. Add `.worktrees/` to `.gitignore` in the first commit.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the package skeleton**

`pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project]
name = "vivado-runners"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Sandboxed per-job KVM GitHub Actions runners with Vivado"
requires-python = ">=3.11"
license = "Apache-2.0"
dependencies = ["PyJWT>=2.6", "cryptography>=41"]

[project.scripts]
vivado-runners = "vivado_runners.cli:main"

[dependency-groups]
dev = ["pytest>=8", "ruff>=0.6"]

[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/vivado_runners"]

[tool.ruff]
target-version = "py311"
line-length = 120

[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["E", "W", "F", "I", "UP", "B", "SIM", "RUF"]

[tool.pytest.ini_options]
testpaths = ["tests"]
pythonpath = ["."]
```

`src/vivado_runners/__init__.py`:

```python
"""Sandboxed per-job KVM GitHub Actions runners with Vivado."""

__version__ = "0.1.0"
```

`tests/test_smoke.py`:

```python
import vivado_runners


def test_version_is_a_string():
    assert isinstance(vivado_runners.__version__, str)
```

`.gitignore`:

```
.worktrees/
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.egg-info/
dist/
built-debs/
debian/changelog
tmp/
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the test**

Run: `uv run pytest -v`
Expected: `1 passed`. (`pythonpath = ["."]` in the pytest config is what lets later tests import `tests.fakes`.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Add CI**

`.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:
  group: ci-${{ github.event.pull_request.number || github.sha }}
  cancel-in-progress: true

jobs:
  test:
    name: Lint and unit tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
      - name: Lint
        run: uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
      - name: Tests
        run: uv run pytest -v
```

- [ ] **Step 7: Copy the spec and plans, and check the spec already carries the six differences**

Copy the spec and the three plan files from test-designs branch `docs/vivado-runners-spec` into `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/`. The spec was revised on 2026-10-03 to include the differences listed above; confirm each of these is true of the copy, and fix any that is not:

- "Slot loop" step 6 does not copy `_diag`, and "Observability" ties a log line to a run by the runner name.
- "Slot loop" says one thread per slot.
- "Golden runner image" has no `--disableupdate`; it says the image is rebuilt at least monthly.
- "Rollout" Phase 1's exit check does not mention booting an image; Phase 2's work includes the first image build and first boot.
- "Repositories and ownership" says the package is published with `mithro/apt-repo-action`.
- D-2 reads "Decided 2026-10-02".

- [ ] **Step 8: Write the README**

`README.md` (complete content):

```markdown
# fpgas.online Vivado runners

Self-hosted GitHub Actions runners that build FPGA bitstreams with AMD Vivado.
Every job runs in a fresh KVM virtual machine that is destroyed afterwards. A
VM can reach GitHub and nothing else.

- Design: [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-vivado-runners-design.md](docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-25-vivado-runners-design.md)
- Measured numbers: [docs/measurements.md](docs/measurements.md)

## Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `src/vivado_runners/` | The controller service and its CLI |
| `host/` | libvirt network, nftables table and squid allowlist |
| `image/` | Scripts that build the VM image and the Vivado disk |
| `tools/` | Helpers for measurements |

## Development

    uv run pytest
    uv run ruff check .

Vivado and any image containing it stay on the runner hosts. Never upload them:
AMD's licence allows installing Vivado, not redistributing it.
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit, push, open PR A**

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Skeleton: package, CI, design spec and plans"
git push -u origin skeleton
gh pr create --title "Skeleton: package, CI, design spec and plans" --body "Empty package with lint and test CI, plus the design spec and implementation plans moved from fpgas.online-test-designs#93."
```

Expected: the `CI` workflow passes. Then close test-designs PR #93 with a comment linking the new repo (ask Tim first: it is his PR to close).

---

### Task 2: Configuration

**Files:**
- Create: `src/vivado_runners/config.py`
- Test: `tests/test_config.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `load(path: Path) -> Config`; `ConfigError`; `MAX_SLOTS = 8`; `SUBNET = "192.168.76"`. The file describes no host: the same file is valid on any machine.
  `Config` fields: `host: str`, `state_dir: Path`, `min_free_gib: int`, `network: str`, `proxy: str`, `github: GithubConfig`, `slots: SlotsConfig`; properties/methods `images_dir`, `status_dir`, `console_dir`, `runner_prefix`, `slot_dir(i)`, `slot_mac(i)`, `slot_ip(i)`, `domain_name(i)`, `domain_prefix`.
  `GithubConfig`: `org`, `app_id: int`, `installation_id: int`, `key_file: Path`, `runner_group`.
  `SlotsConfig`: `count`, `vcpus`, `memory_gib`, `scratch_gib`, `wall_limit_minutes`, `register_timeout_minutes`, `labels: tuple[str, ...]`, `numa_pinning: bool = True`.
  Also `BRIDGE = "vrbr0"`. `host` defaults to the machine's short hostname, lower-cased, and must match `^[a-z0-9][a-z0-9-]{0,30}$`: it is part of every runner and VM name, and start-up cleanup removes whatever carries it.

### Task 4: GitHub client

API facts (docs.github.com REST "Self-hosted runners", checked 2026-10-02):
`POST /orgs/{org}/actions/runners/generate-jitconfig` takes `name`, `runner_group_id`, `labels` (1-100), optional `work_folder`, and returns 201 with `{"runner": {"id": ...}, "encoded_jit_config": "..."}`. `GET /orgs/{org}/actions/runners` returns 200 `{"total_count", "runners": [{"id","name","status","busy"}]}`. `DELETE /orgs/{org}/actions/runners/{runner_id}` returns 204.

### Task 6: Hypervisor

**Files:**
- Create: `src/vivado_runners/hypervisor.py`
- Test: `tests/test_hypervisor.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces:
  - `SlotDisks(overlay: Path, scratch: Path, seed: Path)`
  - `Run = Callable[..., subprocess.CompletedProcess]` called as `run(cmd: list[str], check: bool = True)`
  - `VirshHypervisor(run=_run)` with:
    - `list_domains(prefix: str) -> list[str]`
    - `prepare(slot_dir: Path, base: Path, scratch_gib: int, seed_files: dict[str, str]) -> SlotDisks`
    - `start(name: str, xml: str, slot_dir: Path) -> None`
    - `is_running(name: str) -> bool`
    - `destroy(name: str) -> None` (no error if the domain is already gone)
    - `wipe(slot_dir: Path) -> None`
    - `free_gib(path: Path) -> float`
    - what the host has, read at run time: `numa_nodes() -> list[int]`, `node_cpulist(node: int) -> str`, `host_cpus() -> int`, `host_memory_gib() -> float`, `host_addresses(exclude: tuple[str, ...]) -> list[str]`
  - `VirshHypervisor(run=_run, root=Path("/"))`: `root` is where `/sys` and `/proc` are read from, so tests can describe any host
- The same method set is the contract `tests/fakes.py::FakeHypervisor` implements in Task 7.

Note for the reviewer: `slot_dir` is mode 0700 and owned by the controller's user, so other host users cannot read the seed ISO. libvirt reaches the files because qemu's user is given access by libvirt's DAC driver when the domain starts (it chowns each disk to `libvirt-qemu`) and because Plan 2 puts `libvirt-qemu` in a group that can traverse the directory. If Plan 2's first boot shows qemu cannot open the disks, the fix belongs there (directory group and mode), not here.

  - `Slot(index, cfg, github, hv, group_id, stop, clock=time.monotonic, sleep=None, new_id=None, poll_seconds=5.0)` with `run_once() -> Outcome` and `run_forever() -> str` (returns `"stopped"` or `"halted"`).
  - `tests/fakes.py`: `FakeClock`, `FakeGitHub`, `FakeHypervisor`.

How each outcome is decided:

| Reason | When |
|---|---|
| `finished` | The VM powered off and GitHub no longer lists the runner (an ephemeral runner is removed once it has run its job) |
| `no-job` | The VM powered off but GitHub still lists the runner: it never ran a job. The runner is deleted |
| `register-timeout` | The runner was not `online` in GitHub within `register_timeout_minutes` of boot |
| `wall-limit` | The VM was still running after `wall_limit_minutes` |
| `start-error` | Preparing disks or starting the domain raised |
| `jit-error` | GitHub refused or could not be reached for a JIT config |
| `low-disk` | Free space under `min_free_gib`; nothing was started |
| `stopped` | The controller is shutting down |

NUMA: when `slots.numa_pinning` is on (the default) and the host reports more than one NUMA node, slot `i` is pinned (vCPUs and memory) to node `nodes[i % len(nodes)]`. On a single-node host nothing is pinned. The layout comes from `hv.numa_nodes()`, never from configuration.

Three `FAILURES` in a row halt the slot. `jit-error` backs off 30 s doubling to 600 s. `low-disk` retries after 60 s.

### Task 8: Controller

**Files:**
- Create: `src/vivado_runners/controller.py`
- Test: `tests/test_controller.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `Slot` (Task 7), `GitHubClient` (Task 4), `VirshHypervisor` (Task 6), `Config`, `MAX_SLOTS` (Task 2).
- Produces: `check_capacity(cfg, hv) -> None`, which raises `ConfigError` when the slots need more vCPUs than the host has or more than 75% of its memory (checked on whatever host the controller starts on, before anything else); `startup_cleanup(cfg, github, hv) -> None`; `run(cfg, github=None, hv=None, stop=None, install_signals=False) -> int` (exit code: 0 when stopped, 1 when every slot halted). `install_signals=True` makes SIGTERM and SIGINT set `stop`; only the CLI passes it, so tests never replace pytest's handlers.

### Task 9: Command line

**Files:**
- Create: `src/vivado_runners/cli.py`
- Test: `tests/test_cli.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `config.load`, `controller.run`, `controller.startup_cleanup`, `images.*`.
- Produces: `main(argv: list[str] | None = None) -> int` with subcommands:
  - `run [--config PATH]`
  - `cleanup [--config PATH]`
  - `status [--config PATH]`
  - `sandbox-targets`: prints this host's IPv4 addresses on every interface except loopback and the runner bridge, as space-separated `address:22` pairs. Plan 2 passes them to the sandbox check, so no host's address is ever written into the check script
  - `images list [--config PATH]`
  - `images activate {base,vivado} NAME [--config PATH]`
  Default config path `/etc/vivado-runners/config.toml`.

### Task 10: Host network policy

**Files:**
- Create: `host/network.xml`, `host/vivado-runners.nft`, `host/squid.conf`, `host/allowed-hosts`, `host/allowed-blob-regex`, `packaging/proxy-test.py`
- Modify: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (add job `host-config`)
- Create: `tools/render_sample_domain.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: the five files above, installed by Task 13 to `/usr/share/vivado-runners/host/` (network.xml, vivado-runners.nft) and `/etc/vivado-runners/` (squid.conf, allowed-hosts, allowed-blob-regex).
- Consumes: `domain_xml.render` (Task 5) for the schema check.

Why each rule exists:

- **libvirt network without `<forward>`** is an isolated network: libvirt adds no NAT and no route out. `<dns enable='no'/>` stops its dnsmasq answering DNS; it still serves DHCP, with one fixed lease per slot MAC and no default gateway. With no IPv6 `<ip>` element libvirt disables IPv6 on the bridge.
- **`<port isolated='yes'/>`** (in the domain XML) stops guests talking to each other at layer 2. **`clean-traffic`** stops a guest using another MAC or IP, so the proxy log's source address identifies the slot.
- **nftables table at priority -10** runs before docker's and libvirt's `filter` chains (priority 0). A `drop` is final whatever later chains say, so those tools cannot open a hole. The table accepts only DHCP and the proxy port from the bridge.
- **squid** allows `CONNECT` to port 443 for names on the allowlist only. IP literals are refused first: squid would otherwise reverse-resolve the address for `dstdomain`, and whoever owns an address controls its PTR record.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the libvirt network**

`host/network.xml`:

```xml
<network>
  <name>vivado-runners</name>
  <bridge name='vrbr0' stp='off' delay='0'/>
  <dns enable='no'/>
  <ip address='192.168.76.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
    <dhcp>
      <host mac='52:54:00:76:00:00' ip='192.168.76.10'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:76:00:01' ip='192.168.76.11'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:76:00:02' ip='192.168.76.12'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:76:00:03' ip='192.168.76.13'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:76:00:04' ip='192.168.76.14'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:76:00:05' ip='192.168.76.15'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:76:00:06' ip='192.168.76.16'/>
      <host mac='52:54:00:76:00:07' ip='192.168.76.17'/>
    </dhcp>
  </ip>
</network>
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the nftables table**

`host/vivado-runners.nft`:

```
#!/usr/sbin/nft -f
# Runner VMs may reach DHCP and the egress proxy on this host, and nothing else.
# Loaded by vivado-runners-firewall.service and re-asserted every minute.
# Priority -10 runs before docker's and libvirt's filter chains; a drop is final.

table inet vivado_runners
delete table inet vivado_runners

table inet vivado_runners {
	chain input {
		type filter hook input priority -10; policy accept;
		iifname != "vrbr0" return
		meta nfproto ipv4 udp dport 67 accept
		ip saddr 192.168.76.0/24 ip daddr 192.168.76.1 tcp dport 3128 accept
		limit rate 10/second log prefix "vr-drop-in: "
		counter drop
	}

	chain forward {
		type filter hook forward priority -10; policy accept;
		iifname "vrbr0" limit rate 10/second log prefix "vr-drop-fwd: "
		iifname "vrbr0" counter drop
		oifname "vrbr0" counter drop
	}
}
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the squid configuration and allowlists**

`host/squid.conf`:

```
# Egress proxy for runner VMs: HTTPS CONNECT to GitHub and nothing else.
# A dedicated squid instance (vivado-runners-proxy.service), not the system one.

http_port 192.168.76.1:3128
pid_filename /run/vivado-runners-proxy/squid.pid
cache deny all
cache_log /var/log/vivado-runners/proxy-cache.log
logformat vr %tl %>a %Ss/%03>Hs %rm %ru
access_log daemon:/var/log/vivado-runners/proxy-access.log vr
coredump_dir /var/log/vivado-runners
shutdown_lifetime 1 seconds

acl runners src 192.168.76.0/24
acl CONNECT method CONNECT
acl https_port port 443
# An address instead of a name. Refused before any name rule: squid would
# reverse-resolve it, and the address's owner controls that answer.
acl ip_literal url_regex ^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(:[0-9]+)?$ ^\[
acl github dstdomain "/etc/vivado-runners/allowed-hosts"
acl github_blob dstdom_regex "/etc/vivado-runners/allowed-blob-regex"

http_access deny !runners
http_access deny !CONNECT
http_access deny !https_port
http_access deny ip_literal
http_access allow github
http_access allow github_blob
http_access deny all
```

`host/allowed-hosts` (a leading dot matches the name and every subdomain; squid rejects a file that lists both a name and its parent with a dot):

```
# GitHub's self-hosted runner requirements (docs.github.com, read 2026-09-24).
github.com
api.github.com
codeload.github.com
.actions.githubusercontent.com
objects.githubusercontent.com
objects-origin.githubusercontent.com
github-releases.githubusercontent.com
release-assets.githubusercontent.com
```

`host/allowed-blob-regex`:

```
# Azure storage accounts GitHub uses for logs, artifacts and caches.
# INITIAL VALUE: every Azure storage account, which is far wider than GitHub.
# Plan 2 Task 6 replaces this line with the account names seen in proxy logs
# (decision D-1 if they cannot be narrowed).
\.blob\.core\.windows\.net$
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the sample-domain renderer for the schema check**

`tools/render_sample_domain.py`:

```python
"""Print the domain XML for a sample slot, for `virt-xml-validate` in CI."""

from pathlib import Path

from vivado_runners.domain_xml import DomainSpec, render

print(
    render(
        DomainSpec(
            name="vr-sample-0",
            vcpus=8,
            memory_gib=24,
            mac="52:54:00:76:00:00",
            ip="192.168.76.10",
            network="vivado-runners",
            overlay=Path("/var/lib/vivado-runners/slot-0/overlay.qcow2"),
            vivado=Path("/var/lib/vivado-runners/images/vivado-2025.2-2026-10-02.squashfs"),
            seed=Path("/var/lib/vivado-runners/slot-0/seed.iso"),
            scratch=Path("/var/lib/vivado-runners/slot-0/scratch.qcow2"),
            console_log=Path("/var/lib/vivado-runners/console/slot-0.log"),
            cpuset="0-3,8-11",
            numa_node=0,
        )
    )
)
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Write the proxy behaviour test**

`packaging/proxy-test.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
"""Start squid with host/squid.conf and check what it lets through.

Run as root in a clean debian:trixie container with the repository at the
current directory. The only change made to the configuration is the address:

  'apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends squid curl ca-certificates python3 && python3 packaging/proxy-test.py'
```

Expected: every line starts with `ok`, and the exit status is 0. (This exact script and configuration were run when the plan was written, 2026-10-02: 4 allowed, 9 refused, exit 0.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Add the CI job**

Append to `jobs:` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
  host-config:
    name: Host config syntax
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5
      - uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v6
      - name: Install squid, nftables and the libvirt schemas
        run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends squid nftables libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-driver-qemu
      - name: nftables table parses
        run: sudo nft -c -f host/vivado-runners.nft
      - name: squid configuration parses
        run: |
          sudo install -D -m 0644 host/allowed-hosts /etc/vivado-runners/allowed-hosts
          sudo install -D -m 0644 host/allowed-blob-regex /etc/vivado-runners/allowed-blob-regex
          sudo install -d -o proxy -g proxy /var/log/vivado-runners /run/vivado-runners-proxy
          sudo squid -k parse -f host/squid.conf
      - name: squid allows GitHub and refuses everything else
        run: >-
          docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src:ro" -w /src debian:trixie sh -c
          'apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends squid curl ca-certificates python3 && python3 packaging/proxy-test.py'
      - name: libvirt network matches the schema
        run: virt-xml-validate host/network.xml network
      - name: domain XML matches the schema
        run: |
          mkdir -p tmp
          uv run python tools/render_sample_domain.py > tmp/domain.xml
          virt-xml-validate tmp/domain.xml domain
```

`squid -k parse` prints warnings to stderr and still exits 0. Read the job log: a line containing `WARNING` or `ERROR` (for example a name that is a subdomain of another entry) must be fixed in the file, not ignored.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit, push, open PR C**

```bash
git add host packaging/proxy-test.py tools/render_sample_domain.py .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "host: isolated libvirt network, nftables table and squid allowlist"
git push -u origin host-config
gh pr create --title "Host network policy: libvirt network, nftables, squid allowlist" --body "Static configuration. CI checks the syntax of all of it and the behaviour of the squid allowlist (what it tunnels and what it refuses). What a real VM can reach through the bridge and the nftables table is proven in Plan 2 by the sandbox acceptance workflow, not here."
```

Expected: `host-config` job green. This proves the configuration parses and the proxy's allowlist behaves; it does not exercise the bridge or the nftables table. Say so in the PR.

### Task 11: The runner image

**Files:**
- Create: `image/versions.toml`, `image/build_image.py`, `image/provision.py`, `image/guest/vivado-runner-boot`, `image/guest/vivado-runner.service`
- Test: `tests/test_build_image.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `images.next_base_name` (Task 3).
- Produces:
  - `image/build_image.py` CLI: `uv run python image/build_image.py --images-dir DIR --lock UV_LOCK --pyproject PYPROJECT [--work-dir DIR] [--network default]`. Writes `DIR/runner-base-<date>.<n>.qcow2` and prints its name. Does **not** change `runner-base-current`.
  - In the guest: `/etc/vivado-runner-image.json` with keys `built`, `runner_version`, `uv_version`, `python_version`, `lock_sha256`, `debian_image_sha512`.
  - Guest contract (Plan 3's workflows rely on it): user `runner` (no sudo), `uv` on `PATH`, CPython from `versions.toml`, `/opt/Xilinx` mounted read-only, work directory on the scratch disk, `HTTPS_PROXY`/`https_proxy` set, `UV_PYTHON` set to that CPython version, `UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never`, `UV_LINK_MODE=copy`.

How the build works: the Debian 13 `generic` cloud image (full kernel, so squashfs is available) is copied, grown to 20 GiB and booted once on libvirt's `default` NAT network with a cloud-init seed ISO. cloud-init runs `provision.py`, which installs everything and powers the VM off. The host reads the manifest out of the stopped image with `virt-cat` to confirm provisioning finished, then writes a compressed copy under its version name. This build VM is trusted (it runs our script, no job), so reading its disk is fine.

- [ ] **Step 1: Pin versions**

`image/versions.toml` (checksums read from the release pages on 2026-10-02):

```toml
[runner]
version = "2.337.0"
sha256 = "70920811a4f8ad4328818682bca5c6469c1c942fab52448868071d0063816613"

[uv]
version = "0.12.10"
sha256 = "173d95a0c32d18c896c46ba6fafbf3cf9c14ab74b033f81b76c883ef492a976b"

[python]
version = "3.12"

[debian]
# The checksum is read from SHA512SUMS beside the image at build time and
# recorded in the image manifest.
base_url = "https://cloud.debian.org/images/cloud/trixie/latest"
image = "debian-13-generic-amd64.qcow2"
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the guest boot script**

`image/guest/vivado-runner-boot` (mode 0755):

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

### Task 12: The Vivado disk

**Files:**
- Create: `image/build_vivado_disk.py`
- Test: `tests/test_build_vivado_disk.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `uv run python image/build_vivado_disk.py --source /opt/Xilinx/2025.2 --images-dir DIR [--exclude REL ...]`. Writes `DIR/vivado-<version>-<date>.squashfs` whose root contains one directory, `<version>/`, so mounting it at `/opt/Xilinx` gives `/opt/Xilinx/2025.2/Vivado/settings64.sh`. Does not change `vivado-current`.
- `command(source, dest, excludes) -> list[str]` and `output_name(source, date) -> str` for the tests.
- `is_machine_tied(text: bytes) -> bool` and `machine_tied_licences(source) -> list[Path]`: a `.lic` file is tied to a machine when it has a `HOSTID=` other than `ANY`/`DEMO`, or a `SERVER`/`USE_SERVER` line. `main()` refuses to build when the source tree holds one, because the disk is attached, readable, to every job's VM. (Checked on the real `/opt/Xilinx/2025.2` when this plan was written: it holds two `.lic` files, both AMD's generic `HOSTID=ANY` ones, and the scan took about 8 seconds.)

```bash
git add image/build_vivado_disk.py tests/test_build_vivado_disk.py
git commit -m "image: pack a Vivado install into a versioned squashfs disk"
git push -u origin image-build
gh pr create --title "Image build: runner base image and Vivado disk" --body "Build scripts with unit tests for their command construction. Neither script has been run against a hypervisor or a real Vivado install yet: Plan 1 Task 14 runs the Vivado disk build on the machine with the Vivado install, and Plan 2 runs the image build on a runner host."

### Task 13: Debian package

**Files:**
- Create: `debian/control`, `debian/rules`, `debian/copyright`, `debian/source/format`, `debian/vivado-runners.install`, `debian/vivado-runners.dirs`, `debian/vivado-runners.postinst`, `debian/vivado-runners.vivado-runners.service`, `debian/vivado-runners.vivado-runners-proxy.service`, `debian/vivado-runners.vivado-runners-firewall.service`, `debian/vivado-runners.vivado-runners-firewall.timer`, `debian/config.toml.example`
- Create: `.github/workflows/deb.yml`, `.github/apt-packaging.toml`, `packaging/install-test.py`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: package `vivado-runners` (Architecture: all). Installed paths:
  - `/usr/bin/vivado-runners`
  - `/usr/share/vivado-runners/host/{network.xml,vivado-runners.nft}`
  - `/usr/share/vivado-runners/image/` (everything under `image/`)
  - `/etc/vivado-runners/{squid.conf,allowed-hosts,allowed-blob-regex}` (conffiles)
  - `/usr/share/doc/vivado-runners/config.toml.example`
  - units `vivado-runners.service`, `vivado-runners-proxy.service`, `vivado-runners-firewall.service`, `vivado-runners-firewall.timer`, all installed **disabled and stopped** (Plan 2 enables them once the config and key exist)
  - user `vivado-runners` in groups `libvirt` and `libvirt-qemu`; directories `/var/lib/vivado-runners/{images,status,console}` and `/var/log/vivado-runners`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the packaging files**

Description: sandboxed per-job KVM GitHub Actions runners with Vivado
 A controller that keeps a fixed number of GitHub Actions runner slots. Each
 job runs in a fresh KVM virtual machine that is destroyed afterwards. The
 machine gets a single-use runner registration and can reach GitHub, through
 an allowlisting proxy on the host, and nothing else.
 .
 The package also carries the host network policy (libvirt network, nftables
 table, squid allowlist) and the scripts that build the VM image and the
 read-only Vivado disk. Vivado itself is not included.
```

`debian/rules`:

```make
#!/usr/bin/make -f

export PYBUILD_NAME=vivado-runners

%:
	dh $@ --with python3 --buildsystem=pybuild

# The unit tests run in CI (ci.yml) with uv; the package build does not repeat them.
override_dh_auto_test:

# Installed disabled and stopped: the controller needs a config file and the
# GitHub App key, and the proxy needs the bridge. Deployment enables them.
# One call per unit name; each also picks up a .timer of the same name.
override_dh_installsystemd:
	dh_installsystemd --name=vivado-runners --no-enable --no-start

The `.nft` file begins by declaring and deleting its own table, so loading it again replaces the table in one transaction.

- [ ] **Step 2: Write the install test**

sh("squid", "-k", "parse", "-f", "/etc/vivado-runners/squid.conf")
check(True, "the installed squid configuration parses")
print("install test passed")
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the package workflow**

`.github/apt-packaging.toml`:

```toml
# How this repository is packaged, and why it differs from the defaults.
# See https://github.com/mithro/apt-repo-action/blob/main/docs/packaging.md

kind = "B"                  # our own code: debian/ at the root of main
architectures = "all"       # Python and configuration only
suites = ["trixie"]         # the runner hosts are Debian 13

[exceptions]
PKG-SUITES = "only the two runner hosts install it, both on trixie"
```

`.github/workflows/deb.yml`:

```yaml
name: Debian package

# Every push to main builds the package and republishes a signed apt repository
# on GitHub Pages. A pull request builds and install-tests, and publishes nothing.
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

concurrency:
  group: deb-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' }}

jobs:
  build-deb:
    name: build-deb (trixie all)
    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - name: Check out
        uses: actions/checkout@v5
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # the version is git describe's

      - name: Build
        uses: mithro/apt-repo-action/build-deb@main
        with:
          suite: trixie
          arch: all

      - name: Install test
        run: |
          docker run --rm \
            -v "${PWD}/built-debs:/debs:ro" -v "${PWD}/packaging:/packaging:ro" \
            docker.io/library/debian:trixie \
            sh -c 'apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 && python3 /packaging/install-test.py'

      - name: Upload
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: debs-trixie-all
          path: built-debs/*.deb
          retention-days: 14

  publish-apt:
    if: github.event_name != 'pull_request' && github.ref_name == github.event.repository.default_branch
    needs: build-deb
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write
    uses: mithro/apt-repo-action/.github/workflows/publish-apt.yml@main
    with:
      suites: "trixie"
      architectures: "all"
      description: "Sandboxed per-job KVM GitHub Actions runners with Vivado"
    secrets:
      gpg-private-key: ${{ secrets.APT_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY }}
```

`publish-apt` needs the `APT_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY` secret and GitHub Pages enabled on the repo. Both are Tim's to set (see `apt-repo-standardisation` in the project notes). Until then the publish job fails on `main` while PR builds stay green; say so in the PR.

- [ ] **Step 4: Build and install-test locally**

Run:

```bash
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/src" -w /src debian:trixie sh -c \
  'apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends build-essential devscripts equivs git && mk-build-deps -i -t "apt-get -y --no-install-recommends" debian/control && printf "vivado-runners (0.1.0~local) trixie; urgency=medium\n\n  * Local build.\n\n -- Local <local@example.invalid>  Fri, 02 Oct 2026 00:00:00 +0000\n" > debian/changelog && dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -b && mkdir -p built-debs && mv ../vivado-runners_*.deb built-debs/'
docker run --rm -v "$PWD/built-debs:/debs:ro" -v "$PWD/packaging:/packaging:ro" debian:trixie sh -c \
  'apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends python3 && python3 /packaging/install-test.py'
```

Expected: the first command ends with `dpkg-deb: building package 'vivado-runners'`; the second ends with `install test passed`. Remove `debian/changelog` afterwards (CI generates it; it must not be committed).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit, push, open PR E**

```bash
rm -f debian/changelog
git add debian packaging .github/workflows/deb.yml .github/apt-packaging.toml
git commit -m "packaging: deb with the controller, host policy and image scripts"
git push -u origin packaging
gh pr create --title "Debian package" --body "Builds and install-tests in a clean debian:trixie container. Units ship disabled. Publishing needs APT_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY and Pages, which Tim has to set."
```

### Task 14: Measurements (spec Phase 0)

Run on a machine that has the Vivado install (today that is desktop.buddy.mithis.com). It does not have to be a runner host, and no hypervisor is needed.

**Files:**
- Create: `tools/allowlist_proxy.py`, `docs/measurements.md`
- Modify: `debian/config.toml.example` (slot sizes), spec section "Vivado disk" (measured size), `image/provision.py` only if the uv experiment says so

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: `docs/measurements.md` with three filled sections: "Vivado peak memory", "Vivado disk size", "uv without PyPI". Plan 2 reads the slot `memory_gib` from it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the logging proxy used by the uv experiment**

`tools/allowlist_proxy.py`:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""A logging CONNECT proxy for experiments. NOT the production proxy (that is squid).

    uv run python tools/allowlist_proxy.py --port 8876 --allow github.com \\
        --allow .githubusercontent.com --log tmp/proxy.log

Every CONNECT is logged as `ALLOW host:port` or `DENY host:port`. `--allow .x`
matches x and its subdomains; `--allow-all` allows and logs everything.

```bash

bash -c 'source /opt/Xilinx/2025.2/Vivado/settings64.sh && /usr/bin/time -v uv run python designs/acorn-pcie/gateware/acorn_pcie_soc.py --variant cle-215+ --toolchain vivado --build' 2> tmp/time-acorn-pcie.txt
grep -E "Maximum resident set size|Elapsed \(wall clock\)" tmp/time-acorn-pcie.txt
```

`acorn-pcie` on `cle-215+` (xc7a200t) is the largest design in the repo. `Maximum resident set size` is the largest single process (Vivado itself), in kB. Record both numbers and the machine they were taken on (`nproc`, `free -g`) in `docs/measurements.md`.

What to expect: when Plan 3 was written (2026-10-02, same machine) this build took 8 min 25 s and peaked at 3.3 GB. A result several times larger means something differs (thread count, a different design revision): find out what before recording it.

Decision rule for the slot size: `memory_gib` = peak RSS in GiB, plus 4 GiB for the guest OS and page cache, rounded up to a multiple of 4, and never under 16. With a 3.3 GB peak that is 16. Write the result into `debian/config.toml.example`, `deploy/inventory.yml` (once Plan 2 has created it) and the spec's config block.

- [ ] **Step 3: Measure the Vivado disk**

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/vivado-disk
uv run python image/build_vivado_disk.py --source /opt/Xilinx/2025.2 --images-dir tmp/vivado-disk
uv run python image/build_vivado_disk.py --source /opt/Xilinx/2025.2 --images-dir tmp/vivado-disk-slim --exclude Vitis --exclude data/xsim --exclude data/simmodels
```

(Create `tmp/vivado-disk-slim` first. Each run takes tens of minutes and needs about 30 GiB free under `tmp/`; check with `df -h .` before starting.)

Record both sizes. To learn whether the slim disk still builds a bitstream without a VM, mount it and build against it:

```bash
mkdir -p tmp/mnt
squashfuse tmp/vivado-disk-slim/vivado-2025.2-*.squashfs tmp/mnt
bash -c 'source tmp/mnt/2025.2/Vivado/settings64.sh && uv run python designs/pmod-pin-id/gateware/pmod_pin_id_acorn.py --variant cle-215+ --toolchain vivado --build'
fusermount -u tmp/mnt
```

(The PMOD pin-ID design is used because it builds with Vivado on `main` as it is; the SoC designs need Plan 3's first fix. `squashfuse` is an unprivileged FUSE mount; if it is not installed, ask Tim to install it or to run `sudo mount -o ro,loop` for you. Run the build from the test-designs worktree with absolute paths to the mount.)

Decision rule: if that build produces `designs/pmod-pin-id/build/acorn/top.bit` from the slim disk, the exclusions `Vitis`, `data/xsim`, `data/simmodels` become the documented default in the README's "Building the Vivado disk" section; otherwise the full disk is the default and the README says which exclusion broke the build. Delete both squashfs files from `tmp/` when done: they contain Vivado and must not be left where they could be committed or uploaded.

- [ ] **Step 4: Find out what `uv sync` needs when PyPI is blocked**

In the test-designs worktree, with an empty cache directory under `tmp/`:

```bash
export UV_CACHE_DIR="$PWD/tmp/uv-cache"
uv sync --frozen --extra build --no-install-project          # 1. warm the cache, online
uv run --project ~/github/fpgas-online/fpgas.online-vivado-runners python \
  ~/github/fpgas-online/fpgas.online-vivado-runners/tools/allowlist_proxy.py \
  --port 8876 --allow github.com --allow .github.com --allow .githubusercontent.com --log tmp/proxy.log &
rm -rf .venv
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8876 HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8876 \
  uv sync --frozen --extra build                              # 2. same lock, PyPI blocked
grep DENY tmp/proxy.log                                       # expect no output
```

Then simulate a lock bump of one git dependency: remove that dependency's built wheel from the cache and sync again through the proxy.

```bash
uv cache clean litex
rm -rf .venv
HTTPS_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8876 HTTP_PROXY=http://127.0.0.1:8876 uv sync --frozen --extra build
grep DENY tmp/proxy.log
```

Stop the proxy (`kill %1`). Record in `docs/measurements.md`: whether run 2 succeeded with no `DENY` lines, and for run 3 the exit status and every denied host.

Decision rule, already agreed with Tim ("only GitHub", accepting image rebuilds on dependency changes):
- Run 2 must succeed with no denials. If it does not, the design's claim that a warm cache is enough is wrong: stop and report to Tim before going further.
- If run 3 is denied (uv asks PyPI for a build backend such as `setuptools`), write this sentence into the README under "When a job fails with a proxy refusal": "A change to `uv.lock`, including a bump of a git dependency, needs a new runner image: build one with `image/build_image.py` and activate it." If run 3 succeeds, write instead that only new or bumped PyPI packages need a new image.

- [ ] **Step 5: Write `docs/measurements.md`**

Use exactly these headings and fill every value from the commands above (no estimates):

```markdown
# Measurements

Taken on <machine> (<n> threads, <n> GiB RAM), Vivado 2025.2,
fpgas.online-test-designs at <commit>, on <date>.

## Vivado peak memory

| Design | Part | Peak RSS (GiB) | Wall time |
|---|---|---|---|
| acorn-pcie cle-215+ | xc7a200t | <value> | <value> |

Slot memory: <peak> + 4 GiB, rounded up to a multiple of 4 = **<value> GiB**.

## Vivado disk size

| Contents | Size (GiB) | A bitstream builds from it |
|---|---|---|
| Full `/opt/Xilinx/2025.2` | <value> | not tested |
| Without `Vitis`, `data/xsim`, `data/simmodels` | <value> | <yes/no> |

Default: <full / slim>.

## uv without PyPI

| Run | Result | Hosts denied |
|---|---|---|
| Warm cache, same lock, PyPI blocked | <ok / failed> | <list or none> |
| One git dependency's wheel removed | <ok / failed> | <list or none> |

Consequence: <the sentence chosen by the decision rule>.
```

The angle-bracket fields are the measured values; a committed file must have none left.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit, push, open PR F**

```bash
git add tools/allowlist_proxy.py docs/measurements.md debian/config.toml.example README.md docs/superpowers/specs
git commit -m "Measurements: Vivado memory, Vivado disk size, uv without PyPI"
git push -u origin measurements
gh pr create --title "Measurements: Vivado memory, disk size, uv without PyPI" --body "Phase 0 numbers, the machine they were measured on, and the slot size and README text that follow from them. The GitHub blob hostnames are measured in Plan 2, where a real runner exists."
```

---

## Self-review checklist (done when writing this plan)

- Spec coverage: controller, slot loop, failure table, observability (`status`, one log line per job, proxy log), images and rollback, network policy, credentials (App key on host, JIT config in VM), Vivado disk, packaging: Tasks 2-13. Phase 0: Task 14, except the blob hostnames and the first boot, which need a real runner (Plan 2). Workflows and releases: Plan 3.
- The spec's `_diag` copy is deliberately dropped (difference 1).
- Host independence: a search of every code block for a real host name, address or CPU list finds none; tests use `alpha` and `beta`; `tests/test_config.py::test_nothing_about_the_host_is_required`, the NUMA tests in `tests/test_slot.py` and `tests/test_hypervisor.py`, and `tests/test_controller.py::test_capacity_is_checked_against_the_host_it_runs_on` hold it in place.
- Names used across tasks: `Config.slot_dir/slot_mac/slot_ip/domain_name/domain_prefix/runner_prefix/images_dir/status_dir/console_dir` (Task 2) are the ones Tasks 7-9 call; `VirshHypervisor` and `FakeHypervisor` share one method set; disk serials `vr-vivado`, `vr-seed`, `vr-scratch` match between Task 5 and Task 11; seed files `jitconfig` and `proxy` match between Task 7 and Task 11.
